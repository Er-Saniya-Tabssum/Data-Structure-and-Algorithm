Learning logic-building with nested loops by solving star/number/alphabet patterns.  

### âœ… **3. STL (Standard Template Library)**  
Exploring C++ STL including vectors, sets, maps, stacks, queues, and algorithms to simplify coding.  

### âœ… **4. Mathematics Basics**  
Covering prime numbers, factors, GCD/LCM, modular arithmetic, and fast exponentiation.  

### âœ… **5. Basic Recursion**  
Understanding recursion flow, base and recursive cases, and solving simple recursive problems.  

### âœ… **6. Sorting Algorithms**  
Implementing Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, and Quick Sort with complexity analysis.

Learning binary search on arrays and applying it on answers in problems.  

### âœ… **8. Searching (Linear & Variants)**  
Solving problems using linear search and its variations, useful for small datasets.  

### â¬œ **9. Two Pointers**  
Efficient techniques to solve array/string problems by using two indices simultaneously.

Learning bit operations, XOR tricks, and bitmasking for subsets and optimization.  

### â¬œ **13. Linked List**  
Implementing singly, doubly, and circular linked lists with operations like insert, delete, reverse.  

### â¬œ **14. Stack & Queue**  
Understanding stack (LIFO) and queue (FIFO), solving problems like Next Greater Element, balanced brackets.  

### â¬œ **15. Heap / Priority Queue**  
Using heaps for efficient top-k problems, priority scheduling, and heap sort.  

### â¬œ **16. Greedy Algorithms**  
Applying local-to-global optimization techniques on problems like activity selection and intervals.  

### â¬œ **17. Backtracking**  
Exploring recursion with choices & constraints; solving N-Queens, Sudoku, and subset generation.  

### â¬œ **18. Binary Trees**  
Studying traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder, level order), height, diameter, and views.  

### â¬œ **19. Binary Search Trees (BST)**  
Working on ordered data, validation, insertion, deletion, and finding LCA.  

### â¬œ **20. Graphs**  
Graph representation, BFS, DFS, shortest paths (Dijkstra), and MST algorithms.  

### â¬œ **21. Trie**
